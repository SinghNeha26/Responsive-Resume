# Responsive Portfolio-site
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>This is my Personal Portfolio or website that looks great on mobile, tablet 
and desktop (so in other words, we will make it responsive!). We will be doing 
this with HTML and CSS, with the tiniest bit of JavaScript.<br>

For this project, I've added media queries to the <a href="https://github.com/SinghNeha26/Responsive-Resume">Basic Portfolio</a> assignment.<br>
